# Rashnu

**Rashnu** is the Zoroastrian deity of truth and justice—the one who weighs souls on a golden scale.  
This R package, developed by **Zarathu**, draws inspiration from Rashnu’s role as the divine judge to offer precision and fairness in sample size determination.

> *"Where truth is weighed, science begins."*

In clinical trials and research design, every decision matters.  
**Rashnu** helps researchers define the *right* number of participants for:
- Non-inferiority studies
- Superiority comparisons (Lakatos method)
- One-arm survival designs with transformation-based inference

This package brings clarity, rigor, and justice to your design process.



## Installation

You can install the development version of rashnu from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("zarathucorp/rashnu")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(rashnu)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
