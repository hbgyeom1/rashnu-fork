# Rashnu

**Rashnu** is the Zoroastrian deity of truth and justice—the one who weighs souls on a golden scale.  
This R package, developed by **Zarathu**, draws inspiration from Rashnu’s role as the divine judge to offer precision and fairness in sample size determination.

> *"Where truth is weighed, science begins."*

---

In clinical trials and research design, every decision matters.  
**Rashnu** helps researchers define the *right* number of participants for:
- Non-inferiority studies
- Superiority comparisons (Lakatos method)
- One-arm survival designs with transformation-based inference

This package brings clarity, rigor, and justice to your design process.



## Installation

You can install the development version of rashnu from
[GitHub](https://github.com/zarathucorp/rashnu) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("zarathucorp/rashnu")
```

## Example

### Rstudio Addins

Use `rashnuBasic()` or Click **Interactive Sample Size Calculator** Addin 

```r
rashnuBasic()
```

### Two sample survival non-inferiority


```r

   alloc = 1,
   accrualTime = 24,
   followTime = 24,
   alpha = 0.025,
   power = 0.8,
   margin = 1.3
)
```

```r
