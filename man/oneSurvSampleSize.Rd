\title{One-Sample Survival Study Sample Size or Power Calculation}
\usage{
oneSurvSampleSize(
  survTime,
  p1,
  p2,
  accrualTime,
  followTime,
  alpha,
  power,
  side = c("two.sided", "one.sided"),
  method = c("arcsin", "log-log", "logit", "log", "log-swog", "identity")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{survTime}{Time point at which survival is evaluated (e.g., median follow-up time).}

\item{p1}{Expected survival probability under the alternative hypothesis.}

\item{p2}{Survival probability under the null hypothesis.}

\item{accrualTime}{Patient accrual period.}

\item{followTime}{Additional follow-up period after accrual ends.}

\item{alpha}{Significance level (e.g., 0.05).}

\item{power}{Desired statistical power (e.g., 0.8).}

\item{side}{Type of hypothesis test. Either \code{"two.sided"} (default) or \code{"one.sided"}.}

\item{method}{Transformation method for comparison. One of \code{"arcsin"}, \code{"log-log"}, \code{"logit"}, \code{"log"}, \code{"log-swog"}, \code{"identity"}.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector with:
\describe{
\item{SampleSize}{Calculated required sample size.}
\item{Power}{Achieved power with the calculated sample size.}
}
}
\description{
Calculates the required sample size or power for a single-arm survival study using various transformation-based methods,
including arcsine-square root, log-log, logit, and others. This function assumes an exponential survival model.
