\title{Sample Size or Power Calculation for One-Sample Normal Test (Two-Sided)}
\usage{
one_norm_size(mu, mu0, sd, alpha, beta = NULL, n = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{mu}{Numeric. The true population mean under the alternative hypothesis.}

\item{mu0}{Numeric. The mean under the null hypothesis.}

\item{sd}{Numeric. The known standard deviation of the population.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. Significance level (Type I error rate).}

\item{beta}{Numeric (optional). Type II error rate (1 - power). Required when computing required sample size.}

\item{n}{Integer (optional). Sample size. Required when computing power.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item If \code{beta} is provided and \code{n} is NULL, returns the required sample size (rounded up).
\item If \code{n} is provided and \code{beta} is NULL, returns the achieved power of the test.
}
}
\description{
This function computes the required sample size or the achieved power for a two-sided test of a single population mean,
assuming normally distributed data with known standard deviation.
}
\details{
This function assumes a two-sided z-test for a single mean with known variance using normal approximation.
}
\examples{
# Calculate required sample size
one_norm_size(mu = 105, mu0 = 100, sd = 15, alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.2)

# Calculate power with fixed sample size
one_norm_size(mu = 105, mu0 = 100, sd = 15, alpha = 0.05, n = 50)
