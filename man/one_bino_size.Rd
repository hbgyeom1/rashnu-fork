\title{Sample Size or Power Calculation for One-Sample Binomial Proportion Test (Two-Sided)}
\usage{
one_bino_size(p, p0, alpha, beta = NULL, n = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{Numeric. The true proportion under the alternative hypothesis.}

\item{p0}{Numeric. The hypothesized proportion under the null hypothesis.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. Significance level (Type I error rate).}

\item{beta}{Numeric (optional). Type II error rate (1 - power). Required when calculating the required sample size.}

\item{n}{Integer (optional). Sample size. Required when calculating power.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item If \code{beta} is provided and \code{n} is NULL, returns the required sample size (rounded up).
\item If \code{n} is provided and \code{beta} is NULL, returns the achieved power of the test.
}
}
\description{
This function calculates either the required sample size or the achieved power for a two-sided test of a single binomial proportion.
It uses a normal approximation to the binomial distribution for testing whether the true proportion differs from a hypothesized value.
}
\details{
The function uses the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. It assumes a two-sided z-test for a single binomial proportion.

\examples{
# Required sample size for testing p = 0.55 vs p0 = 0.5
one_bino_size(p = 0.55, p0 = 0.5, alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.2)

# Power with fixed sample size
one_bino_size(p = 0.55, p0 = 0.5, alpha = 0.05, n = 100)
