\title{Sample Size or Power Calculation for One-Sample Proportion Test}
\usage{
one_prop_size(
  p,
  p0,
  delta = NULL,
  alpha,
  beta = NULL,
  n = NULL,
  test_type = "2-side"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{Numeric. The true population proportion under the alternative hypothesis.}

\item{p0}{Numeric. The hypothesized proportion under the null hypothesis.}

\item{delta}{Numeric (optional). The non-inferiority or equivalence margin. Required for \code{"non-inferiority"} and \code{"equivalence"} tests.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. Significance level (Type I error rate).}

\item{beta}{Numeric (optional). Type II error rate (1 - power). Required when calculating required sample size.}

\item{n}{Integer (optional). Sample size. Required when calculating power.}

\item{test_type}{Character. Type of hypothesis test. Must be one of \code{"2-side"}, \code{"1-side"}, \code{"non-inferiority"}, or \code{"equivalence"}.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item If \code{beta} is provided and \code{n} is NULL, returns the required sample size (rounded up).
\item If \code{n} is provided and \code{beta} is NULL, returns the achieved power.
}
}
\description{
This function calculates either the required sample size or the power for hypothesis testing on a single population proportion.
It supports two-sided, one-sided, non-inferiority, and equivalence tests, with normal approximation methods.
}
\details{
The function uses normal approximations to calculate sample size and power.
The one-sided test uses a modified variance approach based on the null hypothesis proportion.
}
\examples{
# Required sample size for a two-sided test
one_prop_size(p = 0.55, p0 = 0.5, alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.2, test_type = "2-side")

# Power of a one-sided test with given sample size
one_prop_size(p = 0.6, p0 = 0.5, alpha = 0.05, n = 100, test_type = "1-side")
