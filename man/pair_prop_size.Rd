\title{Sample Size or Power Calculation for Paired Proportion Test (McNemar's Test)}
\usage{
pair_prop_size(p01, p10, alpha, beta = NULL, n = NULL, test_type = "2-side")
}
\arguments{
\item{p01}{Numeric. Proportion of discordant pairs where the outcome changed from 0 to 1.}

\item{p10}{Numeric. Proportion of discordant pairs where the outcome changed from 1 to 0.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. Significance level (Type I error rate).}

\item{beta}{Numeric (optional). Type II error rate (1 - power). Required when computing required sample size.}

\item{n}{Integer (optional). Sample size (number of paired observations). Required when computing power.}

\item{test_type}{Character. Type of hypothesis test. Must be either \code{"2-side"} or \code{"1-side"}.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item If \code{beta} is provided and \code{n} is NULL, returns the required sample size (rounded up) to achieve the desired power.
\item If \code{n} is provided and \code{beta} is NULL, returns the achieved power.
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the required sample size or the achieved power for a paired-sample test of proportions,
such as McNemar's test for binary outcomes in matched pairs (e.g., before-and-after studies or matched case-control).
}
\details{
The test is based on the distribution of discordant pairs in a 2×2 contingency table for paired data.
The formula is derived using a normal approximation for McNemar’s test.
The variance includes a correction term for the squared difference of discordant proportions.

\examples{
# Calculate required sample size for two-sided McNemar test
pair_prop_size(p01 = 0.1, p10 = 0.2, alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.2, test_type = "2-side")

# Calculate power for one-sided McNemar test
pair_prop_size(p01 = 0.05, p10 = 0.15, alpha = 0.05, n = 100, test_type = "1-side")
