\title{Sample Size or Power Calculation for Self-Controlled Case Series (SCCS) Design}
\usage{
sccs_size(p, r, alpha, beta = NULL, n = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{Numeric. Relative incidence (i.e., incidence rate ratio between exposed and unexposed periods).}

\item{r}{Numeric. Proportion of the observation period that is considered at risk (i.e., exposure time fraction).}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. Significance level (Type I error rate).}

\item{beta}{Numeric (optional). Type II error rate (1 - power). Required when calculating required sample size.}

\item{n}{Integer (optional). Number of cases. Required when calculating power.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item If \code{beta} is provided and \code{n} is NULL, returns the required number of cases (rounded up) to achieve the desired power.
\item If \code{n} is provided and \code{beta} is NULL, returns the achieved power.
}
}
\description{
This function calculates either the required number of cases (\code{n}) or the statistical power for Self-Controlled Case Series (SCCS) studies.
It uses a normal approximation to estimate sample size or power based on the relative incidence rate and time-at-risk.
}
\details{
The SCCS design compares event rates during exposed and unexposed periods within the same individual, controlling for fixed confounders.
This function applies a normal approximation to estimate power or sample size, assuming the log-relative incidence follows a normal distribution.
}
\examples{
# Required number of cases for SCCS study
sccs_size(p = 1.5, r = 0.1, alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.2)

# Power of SCCS study with 150 cases
sccs_size(p = 1.5, r = 0.1, alpha = 0.05, n = 150)
