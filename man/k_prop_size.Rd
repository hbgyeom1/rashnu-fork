\title{Sample Size or Power Calculation for Two-Sample Proportion Test with Multiple Comparisons}
\usage{
k_prop_size(pA, pB, tau, alpha, beta = NULL, n = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{pA}{Numeric. Proportion in group A (e.g., treatment group).}

\item{pB}{Numeric. Proportion in group B (e.g., control group).}

\item{tau}{Integer. Number of comparisons (used to adjust alpha level: alpha / (2 * tau)).}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. Overall significance level (Type I error rate).}

\item{beta}{Numeric (optional). Type II error rate (1 - power). Required when computing required sample size.}

\item{n}{Integer (optional). Sample size per group. Required when computing power.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item If \code{beta} is provided and \code{n} is NULL, returns the required sample size per group (rounded up) for desired power.
\item If \code{n} is provided and \code{beta} is NULL, returns the achieved power of the test.
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the required sample size or achieved power for comparing two independent proportions when multiple hypotheses are tested.
It adjusts the significance level using a Bonferroni-style correction based on the number of comparisons (\code{tau}).
}
\details{
The function assumes independent binomial samples and uses a normal approximation.
The alpha level is adjusted for multiple comparisons using a Bonferroni correction (i.e., alpha / (2 * tau) for two-sided tests).
}
\examples{
# Required sample size for multiple comparisons (tau = 3)
k_prop_size(pA = 0.6, pB = 0.5, tau = 3, alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.2)

# Achieved power with known sample size
k_prop_size(pA = 0.55, pB = 0.5, tau = 5, alpha = 0.05, n = 100)
